Change the user used by fdm if run as root to 'debianfdm' instead of '_fdm'
which is not allowed in debian. (Actually I don't quite remember if it's
strictly not permitted by debian's policy, but I've stopped caring.)

+If being run as root, fdm requires a user named "debianfdm" to exist. It will drop
 privileges to this user and its primary group. The user may be added on
 OpenBSD with, for example:
 
-	# useradd -u 999 -s /bin/nologin -d /var/empty -g=uid _fdm
+	# useradd -u 999 -s /bin/nologin -d /var/empty -g=uid debianfdm
 
 It is not necessary to add a user if fdm is always started by a non-root user.
