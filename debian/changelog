fdm (1.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (Closes: #523673)
  * Switching licencing of debian packaging to ISC, which is the same licence
    fdm itself. This will obsolete the need for the openssl-gpl-override.
  * Incrementing compat level, no changes needed.
  * Incrementing Standards-Version; adding 'set -e' to the package's post*
    scripts as the policy wants it (although I really fail to see how that
    implicit technique is any better than the explicit and very clear
    '|| exit 1' which the package used before).
  * Removing 04support_debianbsds.diff, included upstream.
