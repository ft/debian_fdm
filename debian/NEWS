fdm (1.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  In version 1.4 there is a small change in the syntax of fdm.conf.
  Quoting upstream's CHANGES file:

    account and all tokens are now normal match conditions. So, you can
    do useless stuff like:

        match all and all or all ...

    AND, more importantly, matching accounts now CHANGES to require an
    operator and follow the normal left-to-right precedence. So:

        match all account "a*" ...

    Becomes:

        match account "a*" ...

    And:

        match "a regexp" or age > 10 accounts { "acc1" acc2" } ...

    Becomes:

        match accounts { "acc1" "acc2 " } and "a regexp" or age > 10 ...

    fdm 1.4 will emit a warning and convert the old style into the new
    style, but in 1.5 the warning will become an error, and in 1.6 the old
    code will be removed entirely. So update your rulesets!

    Note that due to limitations in yacc, the line number of the rule in the
    warning may be off by a few lines (usually one line too far).

  So, fdm 1.4 still supports the old syntax for transitional purposes.
  Please update your config file(s) to the new syntax, so that updating
  to version 1.5 will be as painless as possible for you.

  Also note that as of version 1.4 of fdm, the trivial database (tdb)
  (http://sourceforge.net/projects/tdb/) is used by fdm for its built-in
  cache. This is the reason for the new dependency for libtdb1.

fdm (1.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with version 1.2 of fdm, the program includes optional
  support for Perl-like regular expression via the PCRE library.
  This debian package is enabling this feature by default.
